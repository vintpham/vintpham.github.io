        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Ross has had plenty of success flashing his ability to throw accurately on time and off schedule during his three seasons in the program, and he was able to do so inside and outside the pocket in 2023. He possesses the physical tools needed to make accurate throws downfield and does a nice job creating space within the structure of the offense to move around and find openings, which helps keep defenses honest. While there are some mechanical concerns that could cause problems if he is forced to press the action, his playmaking ability should earn him a chance to compete for a backup job.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses excellent feel and rhythmic stride timing in his dropbacks.</li>
            <li>Plays with good anticipation and touch when leading receivers through windows.</li>
            <li>Fires deep balls quickly but still manages to put them where only his receiver can catch it.Weaves through traffic without much wasted motion when looking to extend plays.</li>
            <li>Races away from pressure while maintaining good ball security.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        
        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tends to be too deliberate when processing from his initial spot behind center.</li>
            <li>Has trouble finding the correct throwing lane against zone coverage.</li>
            <li>Doesn't have ideal size or length to consistently fit throws over smaller defenders.</li>
            <li>Will occasionally take unnecessary hits after scrambling out of pocket.</li>
        </ul>
