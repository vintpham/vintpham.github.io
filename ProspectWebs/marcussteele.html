        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Steele was part of an athletic group that came through Louisiana Tech over the past few years and made college football fans take notice while playing big roles in the Bulldogs' turnaround under coach Sonny Cumbie. He has been on the rise since his freshman season but finally took off this year after becoming a full-time starter. Steele's ball production jumps out right away, but it is just average once the ball gets in the air. His lack of consistency makes it difficult for him to trust that he will make plays consistently even if everything else around him is working well. While there are some flashes of potential, Steele needs more time to develop before he can become a consistent contributor at the next level.StrengthsLong frame with room to add mass at the pro level.Fluid hips help him flip and go with routes without much trouble.Has experience handling press and off-coverage duties.Has enough speed to run with opponents vertically and horizontally.</p>
        <div class="divider"></div>

            <li>Below-average burst to close gaps on vertical routes.</li>
